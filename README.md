# OpenBNL-Plotting
An example of how to use the eLuxemburgensia digital collection and plotting to visually display data.
## Introduction
This project uses Jupyter Notebooks to encapsulate all information regarding the project.
The notebook requests the a date range from the user.  It then uses those dates to select a list of newspapers published during that time period. 
The newspapers are then plotted showing their periodicity.
## Requirements
* Python 3.12
* [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): HTTP library to run HTTP requests
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): creating visualisations in Python
## Usage
The notebook can be run online using [Binder/JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/natliblux/OpenBNL-Plotting/9237a72eb2796e1663bc72e5bd657c5667106b2e?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fsrc%2FPlotting%20Newspaper%20Data.ipynb).
